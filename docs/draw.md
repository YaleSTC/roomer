# **Draw Process**

## Pre Lottery - Intent and Group Selection

Once the Draw is activated, students must first declare their intent to live on or off campus. Once several students have all declared their intent to live on campus, they can choose who will be a group leader and form groups. Admins can also add students into groups, detailed below, as students *should *form groups themselves.

### Sophomore Housing Lottery

For Sophomores who must remain on campus - it is important that the admin lock them into "on-campus" intent right after beginning the draw. Navigate to the Sophomore Housing Draw, via Draw > All Draw.

This will ensure that rising sophomores cannot report that they are off-campus.

As groups form, admins can watch the progress via the Group Report section of the page. The *Lock Singles/Doubles/Triples/etc *buttons are a system that would allow the admin to block the creation of any more groups of that type.
